# 📦 UM980 GNSS Module – 3D Printable Case

This repository contains a 3D-printable case specifically designed for the **UM980 GNSS module**. It’s part of a DIY GNSS miner setup and is ideal for projects such as Onocoy or dual-use with Geodnet.

## 🧩 Features

- Custom fit for the **UM980 GNSS module**
- Space for a **3010 cooling fan** (soldered directly to the module)  
  – or use a passive **aluminum heatsink** instead
- Two case versions:
  1. **Standard case** – compact, minimal design  
  2. **Splitter version** – extra room for a splitter to share GNSS antenna with another miner (e.g. Geodnet)

## 📄 Part List

A full hardware list is available in the included PDF:  
📎 **[partlist.pdf](./partlist.pdf)**

It contains all required components for:
- the UM980 GNSS module
- cooling options (fan or heatsink)
- cabling and power
- optional splitter setup

## 🖨️ Print Instructions

- File format: `.stl`
- Recommended material: **PETG** or **PLA+**
- Orientation: print flat (bottom side down)
- Supports: **not required**
- Infill: 15–30%

## 🧰 Assembly

1. Place the UM980 module inside the case.
2. Mount the **3010 fan** above the chip – connect power directly to the module pins *(or skip if using a passive heatsink)*.
3. Route the USB-C and antenna cables through the side cutouts.
4. Close the lid – some variants support screw or snap-fit.

## 🔀 Splitter Variant

The "Splitter" case version has space to install a **GNSS splitter**, allowing you to run the UM980 module **in parallel with another GNSS miner** (e.g. for multimining with Geodnet + Onocoy).

> 🛠️ Important: Be sure to use an **active splitter** with power passthrough if your antenna needs voltage.
